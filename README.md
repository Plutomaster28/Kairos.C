   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           kairos.printf("Hello, %s! You have %d new messages.%n", "Alice", 5);
           
           kairos.printf("Enter your name: ");
           String name = kairos.readString();
           kairos.printf("Hello, %s!%n", name);
       }
   }
